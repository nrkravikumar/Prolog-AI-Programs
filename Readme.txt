Installation of Swi:
--------------------
	But here some of the programs are executed by swi but some of not because it has to step one step on it. This is the first time of executing the prolog program so it executed some programs but some or not so its petter to prefer the online swish tool to execute it.

Steps to execute the programs:
------------------------------

	-> First open the browser and search for swish prolog so in search select "https://swish.swi-prolog.org" so it redirects to the site.
	-> In that left side we can observe the "+" symbol so click on it and we can observe "program and notebook".
	-> Tap on program so it creates new program file in that we have to paste the code.
	-> In Right side bottom paste the clause with some parameters as input and click on "run" it can shown in bottom of right side
